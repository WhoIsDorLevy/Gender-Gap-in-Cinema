# Gender Gap in Employment in Cinema
A Project in the course of Digital Humanities, BGU.
In this project we will research the gap between genders in cinema, and the distance of the results to the real world.

# Background
Gender inequality in employment is a well-known issue all over the world.

The employment ratio between women and men by profession is not equal. We would like to examine the representation of the roles of women in cinema, and compare - are the roles of actors and actresses in cinema evenly distributed in a way that is representative of the population? Is there inequality in roles as well, or is there a "correction" and women are more represented in cinema than in reality?

For example: Is the representation of female prime ministers in films made relative to the percentage of female prime ministers in reality?

# Goals
- Investigate the issue of gaps in employment in cinema between genders.
- Investigate equality in leading roles between women and men.
- Compare the distribution of roles in cinema, and the distribution of roles in real life.
- Present data in a visual and engaging way, in order to raise awareness and create discussion and dialogue.

# Work Plan
1. Extract data from IMDB (tsv files).
2. Search for the most common roles with a python script.
3. Sort the roles and create statistics, which will show the percentage of men and women, representing those roles.
4. Extract real-life data (US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS - xlsx files, and potentially more databases) of the same roles we found in IMDB.
5. Make graphs and visualize the differences in several different ways.
6. Show the results in a website.

# Expected Results
We believe that we will find an even bigger gap in cinemas than in real life.

Our final product will be a site that will contain a number of different graphs and visualizations, and will provide us with the answer to the question we have posed.


# Data Sources
https://www.imdb.com/ - IMDB

US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS - https://www.bls.gov/cps/cpsaat11.htm


# Tools
- The information we get through tsv files and xlsx files will be processed using Python libraries.
- The graphs and visualizations will also be processed in Python.
